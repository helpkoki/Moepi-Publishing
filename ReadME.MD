# Website Details Project

## Overview

This project is a simple webpage designed to manage website details. It includes fields for website name, visit site, username, and cPanel URL, as well as buttons for various actions. The page uses Bootstrap for styling and JavaScript for functionality.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- Node.js and npm (for running the development server and managing dependencies)

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   If you have a repository, clone it to your local machine using:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
2 . **Navigate to the Project Directory**
    
    ```bash
    cd <project-directory>

3 . **Install http-server**

If you donâ€™t have http-server installed globally, install it using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install -g http-server

4. **Start the Server**

Run http-server to serve the project files:

```bash
http-server .

By default, http-server serves files from the current directory on port 8080. You can specify a different port if needed:

```bash
http-server -p 8900

5.**Access the Project**

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080 (or the port you specified) to view the webpage.
